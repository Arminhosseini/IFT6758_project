Simple Visualizations
Question 1: Comparing Shot Types
To compare shot types over all teams in a season, we can create a bar chart that displays the number of each shot type (e.g., headers, volleys, penalties) as bars, 
and overlay the number of goals as a line on top of the bars. This will allow us to visually identify the most common and most dangerous shot types.
In the discussion for our blog post, we can analyze the figure and identify which shot type appears to be the most dangerous (highest goal-to-shot ratio) and the most common (highest number of shots).

Question 2: Relationship between Shot Distance and Goal Chance
To analyze the relationship between shot distance and the chance of it being a goal for each season between 2018-19 and 2020-21, we can create scatter plots. 
Each scatter plot will have shot distance on the x-axis and the probability of a goal on the y-axis.
We can calculate the goal chance for each shot distance by dividing the number of goals by the number of shots at that distance.
In our blog post, we can describe the figure for each season and discuss whether there has been much change in the relationship between shot distance and goal chance over the past three seasons.

Question 3: Goal Percentage by Shot Distance and Type
To create a figure that shows the goal percentage as a function of both distance from the net and the category of shot types for a single season, we can use a heatmap. 
The x-axis can represent shot distances, the y-axis can represent shot types, and the color intensity can represent the goal percentage.
In our blog post, we can discuss the findings from the heatmap, identifying the most dangerous types of shots based on goal percentage at different distances from the net.
